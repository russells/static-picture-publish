Statically publish a directory tree of pictures.

Russell Steicke <russells@adelie.cx>


- The published tree of pictures must be in a different location from the
  source tree.  This is because some of the generated images will have the
  same names as the source images.

- Directories and images can be excluded from publishing in the web tree by
  putting them in a section in their containing directory.  The file is
  called .static-picture-publish or .static-picture-publish.txt, and it is
  in INI format.  eg

    [ignore]
    abc.jpg = 1
    def.jpg = 1

  The names must be '= 1' because the parser expects a key and a value.
