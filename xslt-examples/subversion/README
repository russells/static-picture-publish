Subversion produces XML output, with XSL transformations and CSS stylesheets.
This is an example (from https://emu.freenetproject.org/svn/trunk/).

The file index.html was produced by editing index.xml to remove the leading '/'
from "/svnindex.xsl" so that xsltproc could find the xsl file, and running

  xsltproc index.xml > index.html

index.xml contains a DTD.  Removing that makes no difference to the output from
xsltproc.  Modifying the DTD so that the document does not conform to it also
makes no difference.
